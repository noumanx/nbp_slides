# Slide Outline: Holistic Generation of Slide Decks Entirely from Nano Banana Pro

This outline defines the visual scenes for the presentation.
**Constraint**: All slides must strictly follow the `visual_guideline.md` style (The Glass Garden).

#### Slide 1: Title (The Hook)
*   **Layout**: Minimalist Spatial Title.
*   **Scene**:
    *   **Prompt**: A cinematic, high-end title slide. Center stage features a highly refactive, frosted glass sculpture of a banana, glowing softly from within with a warm, organic light. This glass banana represents the Nano Banana Pro kernel—futuristic yet familiar.
    *   Floating in 3D space in front of the banana is the title "Holistic Generation of Slide Decks Entirely from Nano Banana Pro" set in a large, elegant, deep grey sans-serif font (like SF Pro Display).
    *   Below the title, a smaller subtitle "From Collage to Rendering: A New Paradigm" floats with a delicate shadow cast on the background.
    *   The background is a clean, bright #F5F5F7 with subtle caustics refacting from the glass banana. The overall vibe is premium, Apple-like, and meticulously rendered.

#### Slide 2: Context (The Shift)
*   **Layout**: Split composition (Spatial UI).
*   **Scene**:
    *   **Prompt**: A split-screen composition comparing the old vs new paradigms.
    *   On the **Left**, a large vertical frosted glass panel stands upright. Etched clearly on the glass in deep grey text are three key points:
        *   "The Problem: Standard slides are fragmented and disjointed."
        *   "The Goal: Achieve 'Steve Jobs' quality visuals instantly."
        *   "The Shift: From manual 'Assembling' to holistic 'Rendering'."
    *   On the **Right**, visualize the transformation: A pile of chaotic, colorful plastic toy bricks (representing the old "assembling" method) is melting and morphing into a perfect, smooth, reflective liquid metal sphere (representing the new "rendering" method). The transition is fluid and dynamic.

#### Slide 3: The "Old" Way (The Problem)
*   **Layout**: Skeuomorphic Contrast.
*   **Scene**:
    *   **Prompt**: A visual representation of the "Old Way" of making slides. A flat, 2D "sheet of paper" or legacy computer screen floats in the 3D glass environment.
    *   Inside this screen, show a bad PowerPoint slide: A stark white background, a generic "Current Workflow" title in Arial, and three disjointed, flat vector icons (a Gear, a Person, a Computer) that don't match in style.
    *   Bullet points on the screen read: "1. Hunt for separate icons", "2. Manually align boxes", "3. Zero visual consistency".
    *   The screen looks slightly dated or rigid, contrasting with the fluid, beautiful environment around it.
*   **Asset**:

#### Slide 4: The "New" Way (The Solution)
*   **Layout**: Organic Spatial Interaction.
*   **Scene**:
    *   **Prompt**: A beautiful, organic visualization of the "New Way". The three concepts from the previous slide (Process, People, Computer) are reimagined as three translucent, glowing glass capsules hovering in the air.
    *   Unlike the rigid icons, these capsules are organically connected by strands of liquid light or fiber optic threads, pulsing with energy. They feel like a single living system rather than separate parts.
    *   Elegant, floating text labels next to the cluster read: "Holistic Scene Generation" and "Perfect Visual Integrity".
    *   The lighting is exquisite, with caustic patterns dancing on the floor.
*   **Asset**:

#### Slide 5: The Reality Check (The Challenge)
*   **Layout**: Alert State (Red/Orange Tint).
*   **Scene**:
    *   **Prompt**: A slide representing "Challenges". A large, sleek glass panel dominates the view, but it is lit with a warning **orange-red** gradient light, signaling alert.
    *   On the panel, distinct text lists the challenges:
        *   "1. Entropy: Styles drift randomly between slides."
        *   "2. Hallucinations: Fake QR codes and garbled text."
        *   "3. Isolation: No interactivity, just static pixels."
    *   Surrounding the panel, the background environment shows floating, shattered geometric glass shards, visualizing the concept of "Entropy" or loss of control.

#### Slide 6: The Architecture (The Solution Structure)
*   **Layout**: The Container Metaphor.
*   **Scene**:
    *   **Prompt**: A powerful visual metaphor for the "Generative Kernel". Show a central, perfect sphere made of rigid, structural glass and metal framing (The Container).
    *   Inside this container is a swirling, colorful, volatile nebula or fluid (The AI/Probability) that is beautiful but chaotic. The container perfectly holds it in shape.
    *   Text floating next to the structure: "The Generative Kernel: A Deterministic Container for Probabilistic Creativity."
    *   Three labels point to layers of the sphere: "Layer 1: Deterministic Code", "Layer 2: Probabilistic AI", "Layer 3: Constraints & SOP".
*   **Asset**:

#### Slide 7: Technique 1 - Visual Anchoring
*   **Layout**: Reference Board & Input/Output.
*   **Scene**:
    *   **Prompt**: Explaining "Visual Anchoring". On the left, a glass card reads: "Technique 1: Visual Anchoring. Don't describe styles. Show them."
    *   On the right, display the provided **Style Matrix image** floating in space as a holographic reference board.
    *   Next to it, show a simple wireframe cube (labeled "Input") transforming into a fully rendered, glowing crystal cube (labeled "Output"), showing how the style matrix guides the transformation.

#### Slide 8: Technique 2 - Asset Injection
*   **Layout**: Organic Integration Close-up.
*   **Scene**:
    *   **Prompt**: A stunning macro close-up demonstrating "Asset Injection". A high-quality white ceramic or matte plastic surface, angled to show depth and material.
    *   Embedded deep into this material is the **QR Code**. It is physically etched or inlaid with dark, high-contrast stone or metal. It does NOT look like a flat sticker; it has texture and subtle depth, but the contrast is sharp enough (black on white) to be functional.
    *   The lighting is soft and high-end, highlighting the texture of the etching without creating obscuring glare.
    *   A floating glass label nearby reads: "Technique 2: Asset Injection".
    *   Caption etched into the surface below: "Context Curation: Inject raw pixels, render the lighting and texture."

#### Slide 9: Technique 3 - Delayed Rendering
*   **Layout**: Timeline / Production Line.
*   **Scene**:
    *   **Prompt**: Visualizing "Delayed Rendering". A linear process flowing from left to right.
    *   Step 1: A stack of digital papers with Markdown text (labeled "Content Logic").
    *   Step 2: A heavy, secure padlock (labeled "Lock-down").
    *   Step 3: A glowing, futuristic engine block or rendering prism (labeled "Batch Render").
    *   Step 4: A stream of perfect beautiful slides coming out of the prism.
    *   Text below: "Optimization: Lock content first. Render once at the very end."

#### Slide 10: Methodology (User Generated Software)
*   **Layout**: Deconstructed Toolkit.
*   **Scene**:
    *   **Prompt**: A clean, white laboratory workbench showing the "Generative Kernel Kit".
    *   The kit consists of three distinct, high-tech components laid out neatly:
        *   1. **Core Kit**: A structural metal chassis (representing the Code Skeleton).
        *   2. **Guiding Knowledge**: A glowing holographic manual or data crystal (representing AI Instructions/SOP).
        *   3. **Leverage Tools**: A set of precision lenses or instruments (representing the Asset Pipeline).
    *   Label text: "The Methodology: delivering User Generated Software potential."
*   **Asset**: 
    *   imgs/style_matrix_0.jpg

#### Slide 11: The Philosophy (Beyond DRY)
*   **Layout**: Concept Comparison.
*   **Scene**:
    *   **Prompt**: A philosophical comparison slide.
    *   On the **Left**: A standard, mass-produced grey plastic chair, looking boring and rigid. Label: "The Product (Static)".
    *   On the **Right**: A mesmerizing, self-assembling structure made of small, intelligent modules, forming a unique shape. It looks alive and capable of becoming anything. Label: "The Generative Potential".
    *   Center text: "Beyond DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). Moving from Static Deliverables to Generative Systems."
    *   Subtext: "Intention Fidelity | Expression Range | User Efficiency"
